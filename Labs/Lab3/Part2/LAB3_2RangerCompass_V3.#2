Description (ranger)
	Initialize everything
		start while (1) loop
			if 80ms has passed
				call ranger function
				print range - (printing every 80ms may be more than needed)
Steps
1. Write a ranger function that reads the ultrasonic ranger.
2. Check the ranger for accuracy.
– Hold an object above the car, measure the height with the ranger and with a tape
measure.
– Repeat for several distances
– Repeat with a piece of carpet
– What is the closest an object can be and you still get reliable readings?
3. Check the ranger for sensitivity to objects off to the side. Crudely estimate the angular
sensitivity of the ranger. Record the information of ranger sensitivity in your lab notebook
and have a TA verify the performance of the ranger.

Description (compass)
	Initialize everything
		start while (1) loop
			if 40ms has passed,
				call heading function
				print heading

1. Write a compass function that reads the electric compass.
2. Check the heading for accuracy.
– The magnetic directions will be indicated in an area of the room with low interference
– Place the car on the floor near these markings and make reading with the car heading
North, East, South, and West
– Note the orientation of the module. It must be mounted on the small protoboard toward
the front of the car and hanging out in front as much as possible to avoid stray
fields from other iron parts. Its reference will then be in line with the car. So when the
car is aligned North, the sensor should read about 0 degrees.
– Note that the room has a fair amount of magnetic interference. The direction of
‘North’ will depend on where you are located, especially if you are near an active
power conduit.
3. If your readings are within 10 degrees of the lines, then show the results to a TA.
4. If the readings vary by more than 10 degrees, then the sensor should be calibrated following
the procedure in Compass_calibration on LMS with the Laboratory 3 handouts.
5. Record the results in you lab notebook and have a TA verify the results, even if you don't get
any better accuracy than what you started with.
6. Record these readings in your lab notebook
