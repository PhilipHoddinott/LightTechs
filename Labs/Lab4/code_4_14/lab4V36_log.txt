will remove result variable
	from LCD print
	and from drive motor
	and from main

will see if PW can be removed


will move calibration to bottem of file

ask TA/prof about the data varibles?

	unsigned char comp_addr = 0xC0;//the address of the sensor
	unsigned char comp_Data[2];  //data in array with length 1
	unsigned char range_addr = 0xE0;// the address of the ranger is 0xE0
	unsigned char range_Data[2];//range data array
	unsigned char ping_addr= 0xE0;//declare addr
	unsigned char ping_Data[1];//ping data array


	could they be combind?? could we have instead 

	unsigned char comp_addr = 0xC0;//the address of the sensor
	unsigned char comp_and_range_Data[2];  //range and comp data array
	unsigned char range_and_ping_addr = 0xE0;// the address of the ranger is 0xE0
	unsigned char ping_Data[1];//ping data array


MOTOR_NEUT is now a define

moved f to calibration

moved input to calibration
