varible result has been removed
	it's spot in LCD print was repced by a holding varible

varible PW and MOTOR_PW have been 
	they have been replaced by MOTOR_PW_AND_STEER_PW

the varibles used for the ranger and the compass
	unsigned char comp_addr = 0xC0;//the address of the sensor
	unsigned char comp_Data[2];  //data in array with length 1
	unsigned char range_addr = 0xE0;// the address of the ranger is 0xE0
	unsigned char range_Data[2];//range data array
	unsigned char ping_addr= 0xE0;//declare addr
	unsigned char ping_Data[1];//ping data array
HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY
	unsigned char comp_addr = 0xC0;//the address of the sensor
	unsigned char comp_and_range_Data[2];  //range and comp data array
	unsigned char range_and_ping_addr = 0xE0;// the address of the ranger is 0xE0
	unsigned char ping_Data[1];//ping data array

Varible MOTOR_NEUT has been made into a define

varibles f and input have been placed in individual calibration functions

The calibration functins have been moved to bottem of file

NEED TO TEST ALL OF THESE CHANGES

NEED TO ASK TA/PROF
	can we store the calibration varibles so we only have to run that thing once a day?
