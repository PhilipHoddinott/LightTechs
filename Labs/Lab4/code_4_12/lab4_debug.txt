void drive motor, i though we did not do this? speed is set by gain, not range

looking at main
	no calibration exists whithin the main??

also all work has to be today/ thursday cause no open shop firday or wensday

move set speed to control functions
put in a small function that says set the servo to what you want

ad float ratio to xdata ( void choose gain)

add in option to skip calibration
